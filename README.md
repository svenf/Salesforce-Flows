# Salesforce-Flows
Repository to hold different flows

Naming convention for autolaunched flows. 
Object Before/After Short-description-of-the-flow
Salesforce doesn't provide a way to show in the list views if it concerns a before/after flow and on which object. This is why I am applying the above naming convention. It makes it very easy to find the flows for a certain object.
